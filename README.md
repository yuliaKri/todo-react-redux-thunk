# Seequent React Coding Test

## Guidelines

Thanks for interviewing with Seequent! This front-end developer exercise involves a simple React/Redux basic Single Page Application.

- Please review the goals and questions below. 
- Create a branch to complete your tasks on.
- Commit your code to your branch
- Address the goals and questions directly in this README and commit it back to your branch
- When you are complete, please open a PR to master for review

## Timing

We ask that you aim to spend about 4 hours on this exercise. If you finish more quickly, great!

If you reach the 4 hour point, outline the tasks you have left to complete and the strategy you would use to complete them, and then submit the exercise for review.

## Running the Application

- Install NPM: https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm
- `cd react-coding-exercise-<yourname>`
- `npm install`
- `npm start`

## Goals

- [ ] Why is the app not running?
- [ ] Describe your understanding of what the current code base is doing
- [ ] Implement the missing Add Todo feature using the framework provided
- [ ] Implement unit tests for the `TodoList` component and the `todos` state
- [ ] Add some CSS to make your TODO list look a bit nicer

## Questions

- [ ] Are there are bad coding practices being used, are there good coding practices that are missing?
- [ ] How would you better organize this code? Are there components that should be split out?
- [ ] What is missing from this application to allow it to grow with more components and features?
